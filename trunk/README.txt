HW2 Cloth and Fluid Simulation

Collaborators: Matthew Nebel

Cloth:
The simulation of the cloth is stable at certain timesteps, I did not implement any type of explosion prevention.
For my "interesting" new test scene, I created a parachute, as well as implemented a "wind resistance". To see the parachute fully functioning, press 'u' while viewing it. The file is called "parachute.txt".

Fluid:
Compiled. Fluid drop seems to work, then takes on a mind of its own.
